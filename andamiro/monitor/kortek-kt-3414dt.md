# Kortek CRT monitors used on Pump It Up

## Monitor capacitor repair kit for Kortek KT-2114, KT-2914 and KT-3414 series color monitors

The following instructions are transcribed from a printout included in the repair kit from
www.arcadesparepartsandrepair.com to replace capacitors on the aforementioned boards. You can order
the full kit including these instructions at
[www.arcadesparepartsandrepair.com](https://www.arcadepartsandrepair.com/store/components/capacitors/kortek-kt-2914-kt-2114-kt-3414-series-monitor-cap-kit-105c-nichicon/).

Note that the kit does not include the
[filter capacitor C114 220 uF @400V](https://www.arcadepartsandrepair.com/store/components/capacitors/snap-in-capacitor/220uf-400v-nichicon-105c-b-filter-capacitor/)
and needs to be ordered separately.

### Instructions - transcribed

Our kits are designed for alll models within the series so there may be caps in this kit your
specific model doesn't require, and if you have locations that never had caps installed then please
research it or ask before populating the locations because your model probably doesn't use them.

**The following parts are included with this kit:**

* 9x 1 uF @ 50V
* 3x 1 uF @ 100V BP
* 1x 47 uF @ 250V
* 5x 4.7 uF @ 50V
* 2x 47 uF @ 50V
* 6x 220 uF @ 50V
* 1x 3.3 uF @ 50V
* 6x 10 uF @ 50V
* 3x 33 uF @ 50V
* 1x 100 uF @ 50V
* 3x 3.3 uF @ 50V BP
* 2x 1000 uF @ 25V
* 1x 22 uF @ 50V
* 2x 10 uF @ 250V
* 1x 100 uF @ 250V
* 2x 47 uF @ 350V
* 7x 470 uF @ 35V
* 1x 100 uF @ 100V

Be sure to install all of the parts on the monitor even though many of the original parts seem to be
working fine. Age, humidity and temperature will cause the value of electrolytic capacitors to
change. Installing all of the parts will assure many more years of trouble-free service.

Each capacitor is polarized and should only be inserted in one direction. Be sure to watch the
markings for polarity on each capacitor. On the top side of the monitor board where each capacitor
is lcoated can have a positive sign (+)./ Insert the longer lead of each capacitor into the hole
marked positive (+).

Bi-Polar (BP) or Non-Polar (NP) capacitors have no specified polarity and are (Non-Polarized) and
can be installed in either direction. Don't ever install a polirzed cap in a non-polarized cap
location because a polarized cap can only handle current flow in ONE direction where a non-polarized
cap can handle current flow in BOTH directions.

**Make sure the game is unplugged and monitor discharged before installing the following parts at
your own risk:**

A good practice is to always remove old solder from all input headers and reflow new solder on them
to eliminate cold solder joints. Make sure to do this with a connector on the pins otherwise when
you heat them to remove the old solder the pins may drop out of the PCB and also the connector will
keep the pins straight.

**Be sure to double check your work before turning on the power.**

**NOTE:** ON ALL CAPACITORS, YOU MAY USE A HIGHER VOLTAGE, BUT NEVER USE A LOWER VOLTAGE. OUR KITS
MAY INCLUDE HIGHER VOLTAGE CAPACITORS!

### Additional notes

#### Filter cap

C114 - 220 uF @ 400V

#### Unused caps on In The Groove KT-3414DF

The following caps are not populated:

* C130
* C139
* C209
* C305
* C401

Do not populate them as they are not required.

#### Swapped out caps to incrase picture brightness (?)

* C711 swapped with 10 uF @ 350 V instead of 47 uF @ 350 V
* C603 swapped with 10 uF @ 50 V instead of 22 uf @ 50 V
