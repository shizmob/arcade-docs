# `GULDJ-JS`: Beatmania IIDX Rootage art and turntable bypass kit

## Turntable bypass cable

If you upgraded a [C02 wired cabinet](../io.md#c02-io), the turntables are connected to the
sub IO via a serial line that goes to another sub IO behind the front panel
next to the 16seg display. This introduces additional latency as the input
data needs to pass through multiple systems/PCBs until it reaches the game.

This can be reduced by using a so-called "bypass" cable, that connects the
turntables directly to the [BIO2 sub IO](../io.md#bio2-ldj-sub-io) board by emulating the wiring of a
[D01 IO](../io.md#d01-io) based cabinet, reducing latency significantly.

This cable could be ordered with the IIDX Rootage upgrade kit but can also
be easily created from scratch.
